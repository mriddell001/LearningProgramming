//This exercise is about using the built in functions of scanf and printf

/*
Your goal is to write a program that receives from standard input from a single
line that contains the following five data types, space-separated, in this order:
int long char float double

After receiving these inputs, print them each on a newline in the order they
were received. The float value must print out three digits after the decimal and
the double value must print out nine digits after the decimal (use the provided)
links for more information on precision.

For this exercise, you can count that the input will be exactly in the order and
form that I've described. Other exercises may be much more tricky.

To show me that you've completed this, upload your code to GitHub via the terminal
and I will run tests to make sure it passes. The only changes you should make is
in the indicated section below.
